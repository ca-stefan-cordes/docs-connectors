endif::[]

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-consumer,Configure consumer part of connector>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element-consumer,Configure a global element for the consumer part of connector>>.
. <<configure-producer,Configure producer part of connector>>.
. <<configure-global-element-producer,Configure a global element for the producer part of connector>>.
. <<conigure-other-fields,Configure the other connector fields>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.

If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:amazon-kinesis-connector-reference.adoc[Amazon Kinesis Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type `Amazon Kinesis` in the search field.
. Click Amazon Kinesis in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[consumer-configuration]
== Consumer Configuration

[[configure-consumer]]
==== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these sources to use with Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Connector:

* *Kinesis Stream Listener* +
+
Enables a consumer to subscribe to a particular data stream. This source uses the Kinesis Client Library (KCL) to listen from a specified initial point in the stream. It returns individual records.
+
* *Kinesis Stream Batch Listener*
+
Works similarly to *Kinesis Stream Listener*, but returns batches of records instead of individual ones. The size of the batch is dynamic.
+
* *HTTP > Listener*
+
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* *Scheduler*
+
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

For example, to configure the *Kinesis Stream Listener* source, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Kinesis*.
. Drag *Kinesis Stream Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Kinesis Stream Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of *Kinesis Stream Listener* in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify connection information for the connector.
. On the *Security* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[add-connector-operation]]
=== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Connector, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Kinesis* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas to the right of the input source.

[[configure-global-element-consumer]]
=== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, it's best to configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials that the connector requires to access the target Amazon Kinesis Data Streams system. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Connector supports <mention the types of authorization the connector supports>.

To configure the global element for Amazon Kinesis Consumer, follow these steps:

. Select the name of the connector in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. On the *General* tab, configure the following fields:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Name |Name used to reference the connector instance
|Kinesis Client Library | Via configure button select local file of dependency or use maven dependency manager
|Access Key |Alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the AWS account
|Secret Key |Key that plays the role of a password
|Region Endpoint |URL entry point for a web service
|Role | Amazon IAM role
|Default Stream Name | Global value for stream name to be used in all operations
|===
+
You can reference a configuration file that contains ANT-style property placeholders (recommended), or you can enter your authorization credentials in the global configuration properties. For information about the benefits of using property placeholders and how to configure them, see xref:introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc[Anypoint Connector Configuration].
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[configure-producer]]
=== Producer Configuration

To configure producer part of connector you can use Put Record operation which puts a record into a Kinesis Data Stream in batch with aggregation which increases shard throughput. To use that operation follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Kinesis*.
. Drag *Put record* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Put record* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of *Put record* in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify connection information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy and other connection properties.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[configure-global-element-producer]]
=== To configure the global element for Amazon Kinesis Producer, follow these steps:

. Select the name of the connector in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. On the *General* tab, configure the following fields:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Name |Name used to reference the connector instance
|Kinesis Producer Library | Via configure button select local file of dependency or use maven dependency manager
|Access Key |Alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the AWS account
|Secret Key |Key that plays the role of a password
|Region Endpoint |URL entry point for a web service
|Role | Amazon IAM role
|Default Stream Name | Global value for stream name to be used in all operations
|===
+
You can reference a configuration file that contains ANT-style property placeholders (recommended), or you can enter your authorization credentials in the global configuration properties. For information about the benefits of using property placeholders and how to configure them, see xref:introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc[Anypoint Connector Configuration].
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy and other connection properties.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[view-app-log]]

== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you're running the app from Anypoint Platform, the app log output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you're running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log output is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app's log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`. You can configure the location of the log path in the app log file `log4j2.xml`.

== Next Step

After you configure a global element and connection information, configure the other fields for the connector. See xref:amazon-kinesis-connector-config-topics.adoc[Additional Configuration Information] for more configuration steps.
