= Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Connector 1.0 Configuration Information - Mule 4

== Introduction
To use the Kinesis Data Stream connector, you need to first create your connector configuration.
This configuration is what contains the authorization details that allows the connector to connect to the Amazon Kinesis
Data Stream service. The configuration also provides several optional parameters with sane defaults already pre-configured.

== Authentication
To configure the connector you need to provide at minimum these fields:

* Access Key
* Secret Key
* Region

Make sure with your administrator that this account gives you the required read/write permissions to use
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for your intended purpose.

After this has been done, you can start using this connector or you can proceed to configure the other optional fields
available in this configuration.

== Advanced security settings
Apart from the Access Key, Secret Key and Region, there are several additional fields you can set up if you wish to.
